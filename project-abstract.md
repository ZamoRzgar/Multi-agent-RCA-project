Abstract
Single-LLM (Large Language Model) systems for root cause analysis (RCA) of software logs can suffer from hallucinations and tunnel vision, often missing alternative explanations. This paper proposes A multi agent LLM, a novel multi-agent RCA framework in which multiple LLM-based agents analyze the same log data collaboratively using a shared knowledge graph (KG) as memory. Each agent brings a different perspective (e.g. log chronology, knowledge graph relations, metrics), and through structured debate and cross-checking, the agents converge on a more accurate root cause explanation. A final judge agent evaluates the competing hypotheses against evidence from the logs and KG, selecting the explanation that best fits all facts. We demonstrate that this multi-agent approach yields more reliable diagnoses and explanations, reducing hallucinations and improving accuracy over a single-LLM baseline (the original AetherLog)nkcs.iops.ai. In experiments on two industrial log datasets, our model improves RCA F1 scores and explanation quality, especially for complex failure scenarios with long causal chains or noisy data. This work illustrates how “society of minds” multi-agent debate arxiv.org and knowledge grounding can enhance reasoning in LLM-based RCA systems.
