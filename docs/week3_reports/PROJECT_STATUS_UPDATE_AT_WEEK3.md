## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### **Risk 1: KG Population Takes Longer** ⚠️

**Risk**: Populating KG with quality data may take 3-4 weeks instead of 2-3

**Mitigation**: 
- ✅ You're 2 weeks ahead, so you have buffer
- ✅ Can use your 9 tested scenarios as seed data
- ✅ Can start with smaller KG and expand later

**Impact**: Low (you have time buffer)

---

### **Risk 2: Baseline Implementation Complex** ⚠️

**Risk**: Implementing baselines may take longer than planned

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Many baselines have existing implementations
- ✅ Can use simpler baselines if needed
- ✅ Focus on most important comparisons

**Impact**: Medium (but you're ahead of schedule)

---

### **Risk 3: Paper Writing Takes Longer** ⚠️

**Risk**: Writing quality paper may need more time

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ You're 2 weeks ahead, giving buffer
- ✅ Can start writing earlier (Week 10 instead of 13)
- ✅ Already have good documentation to build on

**Impact**: Low (you have time buffer)
